# edX-Metastudio-course-exchange

The aim of this project was to be able to import course content from EdX into the Metastudio platform. For this the structure of how EdX stores courses needs to be understood as well as how Metastudio creates courses.

The code involves XML parsing using Python on the Django framework using MongoDB (NoSQL).

This code was written for the GNOWLedge Lab led by Dr. Nagarjuna at the Homi Bhabha Center for Science and Education (TIFR, Mumbai) in 2013.
